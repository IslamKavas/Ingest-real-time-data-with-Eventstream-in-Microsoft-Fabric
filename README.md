## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates **real-time data streaming** using Microsoft Fabric's Eventstream. I designed pipelines to ingest, process, and visualize live data streams.  

## 🛠️ Key Features  
- **Eventstream Configuration:** Connected live data sources (e.g., IoT sensors).  
- **Real-Time Processing:** Applied transformations to streaming data.  
- **Dashboard Integration:** Visualized results in Power BI.  

## 💡 What I Learned  
- Building **end-to-end event-driven architectures** in Fabric.  
- Optimizing data streams for low latency.  
- Troubleshooting common Eventstream errors (e.g., data source connectivity).  

## 📂 Project Structure  

## 🌟 Future Goals  
- Integrate **Azure Functions** for serverless data processing.  
- Explore anomaly detection in real-time streams.
